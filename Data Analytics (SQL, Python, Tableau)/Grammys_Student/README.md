# The GRAMMYs Project - Website Audience Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes web analytics data for The Recording Academy's websites (grammy.com and recordingacademy.com) to understand audience behavior before and after the split of the two domains. The analysis focuses on trends in website traffic, the impact of the Grammy Awards event, and user engagement.

## Dataset
- **Files:** grammys_live_web_analytics.csv, ra_live_web_analytics.csv
- **Columns:** date, visitors, pageviews, sessions, bounced_sessions, avg_session_duration_secs, awards_week, awards_night

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, plotly.express)
- Data visualization and exploratory data analysis

## Files
- `grammys_analysis.py` - Clean Python script with analysis code and results
- `Grammys_Student.ipynb` - Original Jupyter notebook with instructions

## Key Tasks
- Load and inspect web analytics data
- Visualize daily visitors and identify traffic spikes
- Compare average visitors on awards night vs. regular days
- Analyze the impact of splitting the website into two domains

## Insights
- Website traffic spikes dramatically during the Grammy Awards and nominee announcements
- The split into two domains allows for more targeted audience analysis
- The challenge is to maintain user engagement year-round, not just during the awards season
